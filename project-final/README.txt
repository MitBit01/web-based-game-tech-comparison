This was implemented using NodeJS version 8.10.0 and MySQL version 8.0.11.
This expects a MySQL user with username and password both as "adminmysql" and that the code in init-mysql.sql has been run.
This was ran on Windows 10 Pro. 
To run, navigate to '/{repo}/project-final' and run 'npm install' to install the dependencies.
Run 'node index.js' and open multiple browser tabs to localhost:3000.
